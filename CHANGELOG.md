## 3.1.1 - 2020-11-05

* `getSystemLocale` in `LocalizedHelper` now returns the fallback locale if the given one is not found. This created issues with some tests because NumberFormatter becomes system dependent if null is given.

## 3.1.0 - 2020-11-03

* Add `CountryHelper` facade with `getCountryCodeFromLocale` and `findByLocale` functions.
* Improve `CurrencyHelper` facade with a new function `toStandardFormat`. It returns the typical currency format and can also show a specified number of decimals.

## 3.0.9 - 2020-10-12

* Add `formatToMinorUnitWhenApplicable` method: formats currency with pence when the rate is less than 1.00.

## 3.0.8 - 2020-07-01

* [SWP-1718](https://podpoint.atlassian.net/browse/SWP-1718) - Revert “Republic of Ireland” to have its locale set to ie instead of en

## 3.0.7 - 2020-06-09

### [SWP-1648] DT breaking change on i18n v 3.0.6

* Renaming wrongly named test files.

* Reverting the order when merging countries so that the name in our config is the one that is going to be used.

## 3.0.4 - 2019-07-04

### CurrencyHelper: up to 6 decimals of a monetary unit supported

* PHP NumberFormatter will round up with 2 decimals only by default.
* Sometimes we can display up to 6 decimals of the monetary unit (ex: `£0.106544`) especially for energy prices like `£0.106544 per kWh`.
* If a regular float like `19.99` with only 2 decimals is given, it will still be formatted as usual `£19.99`.

## 3.0.3 - 2019-06-26

* [SWP-36](https://podpoint.atlassian.net/browse/SWP-36) Adding to format from cents helper method with the new `toFormatFromInt` and `moneyFormatFromInt` helpers method.

## 3.0.2 - 2019-05-22

* Adding new abstract `LocalizedHelper` that will have the logic to retrieve a locale in a `NumberFormatter` format
* Changing the currency helper so that it extends the localized helper
* Adding new number helper that allows us to format a number in the right locale
* renaming `format` to `toFormat` for consistency in the `NumberHelper`
* Changing the style from `DECIMAL` to `DEFAULT_STYLE`
