This is a little package that provides Laravel and Lumen applications with full and partial lists of countries. The
country lists are loaded into config using using the keys `countries` and `countries-partial`. The countries are indexed
using their uppercase ISO code.

## Installation

Require the package in composer:

```javascript
"require": {
    "pod-point/countries": "^1.0"
},
```

Then finally, if you're using Laravel, add the service provider to your `config/app.php` providers array:

```php
'providers' => [
    PodPoint\Countries\Providers\CountriesServiceProvider::class
]
```

If you're using Lumen, add the following line to your `bootstrap/app.php` file:

```php
$app->register(PodPoint\Countries\Providers\CountriesServiceProvider::class);
```
